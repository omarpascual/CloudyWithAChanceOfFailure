Selected Projection:

CPU-PXZ: A parallel lossless data compression utility that uses the LZMA algorithm (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm) It uses a dictionary compression scheme

Network Latency - netperf: The network request response benchmark can help measure report round-trip latency

Redis: High performance, rich API and widespreasd use among PaaS providers (e.g, amazon, Elasticache, google compute engine) |

MySQL: Widely used in the cloud that typically stresses memory, IPC, filesystem, and networking subsystem | Running normally on Linux (native) | Under Docker using host networking and a volume (Docker new = host volume), using a volume but normal Docker networking (Docker NAT volume), storing database within the container filesystem (Docker NAT AUFS), and running under KVM
